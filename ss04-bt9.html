    <strong>This is the first item's accordion body.</strong> 
    It is shown by default, until the collapse plugin adds the appropriate 
    classes that we use to style each element. These classes control the overall 
    appearance, as well as the showing and hiding via CSS transitions. 
    You can modify any of this with custom CSS or overriding our default 
    variables. It's also worth noting that just about any HTML can go within 
    the 
    <code>.accordion-body</code>, 
    though the transition does limit overflow.</p>
